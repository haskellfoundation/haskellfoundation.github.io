Laurent joined the Haskell community in 2017. He participates a lot in open-source software developement, and maintains several projects such as Cloud Haskell, Beam, and Hakyll. One of his goals for the Haskell Foundation is to expand the reach of Haskell in industry, by facilitating the learning experience for people curious about Haskell.

Laurent has a PhD in Physics, with a focus on quantum condensed matter. His personal interests include the application of Haskell for high-performance scientific computing, distributed systems, and data science. Today, Laurent works at Bitnomial, a fintech startup running a commodity derivatives exchange and clearinghouse, and whose entire backend is built in Haskell.
