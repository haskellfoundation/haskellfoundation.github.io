Moritz has a background in mathematics but ended up in mobile application development. His interest in reliability, simplicity, and low-power single-board computers/mobile devices drew him to contribute to GHC's Codegen backend. His contributions to GHC expanded over time to include the NCG and LLVM backends, the in-memory linker, and continuous integration infrastructure. A keen interest in solid systems engineering, and cross-compilation further motivated his GHC and tools contributions, culminating in haskell.nix, a nix-based cross-compilation solution.

Currently, Moritz is the Head of Platform Engineering at IOG. In this role, he leads the compiler, developer experience, and infrastructure teams. His work centers on enhancing the Haskell development experience, with a primary emphasis on stability and reliability.
