Edward is currently off founding a stealth startup. He also sits on the board of the Topos Institute, promoting category theory in industry as a tool for exchanging ideas. Outside of Haskell he’s worked on graphics and special effects, telecommunications, finance, linguistics, and once helped Taiwan point a big RADAR at China. Edward found Haskell in 2006 and at the time mistakenly believed all Haskellers were thoroughly fluent in category theory, so he started blogging to this imaginary audience. A few years later his work on lenses provided a more practical impetus for more folks to learn some of these ideas, closing the circle. He currently maintains well over a hundred Haskell libraries covering a rather wide swathe of topics and isn’t entirely sure how he backed himself into that position.
