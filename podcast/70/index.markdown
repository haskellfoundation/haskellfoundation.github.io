We sat down with Phil Wadler, one of the most influential folks in the
Haskell community, functional programming, and programming languages,
responsible for type classes, monads, and much more. We take a stroll
down memory lane, starting from Haskell's inception. We talked about
the difference between research and Phil's work on impactful
industrial projects and standards - specifically XML and the design of
generics in Java, as well as Phll's teaching at the University of
Edinburgh using Agda.. Phil is a fountain of great ideas and stories,
and this conversation could have gone on for hours. As it is, we hope
you enjoy the hour that we had as much as we did.
