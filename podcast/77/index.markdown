Franz Thoma is Principal Consultant at TNG Technology Consulting, and
an organizer of MuniHac. Franz sees functional programming and Haskell
as a tool for thinking about software, even if the project is not
written in Haskell. We had a far-reaching conversation about the
differences between functional and object-oriented programming and
their languages, software architecture, and Haskell adoption in
industry.
