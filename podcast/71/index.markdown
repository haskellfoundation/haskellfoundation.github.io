Stefan Wehr is a professor at the Offenburg University of Applied
Sciences. Before becoming a professor, Stefan worked in industry on a
large Haskell codebase - specifically one that's not a compiler and
not a blockchain. So of course we talked about using Haskell in large
projects, software architecture, modularity, type classes and data
modeling and the suppression of sums outside of functional
programming, and also about teaching Haskell at his current job.
