Mike and Andres speak to Alex McLean who created the TidalCycles
system for electronic music - implemented in Haskell of course. We
talk about how Alex got into Haskell coming from Perl, how types
helped him think about the structure of music and patterns, the
architecture and evolution of TidalCycles, about art, community and
making space for new ideas, and lots of things in between.
