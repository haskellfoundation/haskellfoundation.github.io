This episode is a deep dive into the evolution of Haskell and
functional programming with one of its pioneers, Lennart Augustson. It
reflects on decades of work in language design and compiler
implementation. Lennart speaks about his early involvement in the
creation of Haskell, shares thoughts on type systems, performance, and
the balance between purity and practicality. The conversation ranges
from personal history to big-picture views on the evolution of
programming languages, with plenty of insight into what makes Haskell
both powerful and challenging. A rare opportunity to hear from one of
the foundational voices in the functional programming world.
