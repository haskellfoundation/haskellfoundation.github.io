Niki and Mike talked to Daniele Micciancio who is a professor at UC
San Diego. He's been using Haskell for 20 years, and works in lattice
cryptography. We talked to him about how he got into Haskell, using
Haskell for teaching theoretical computer science and of course for
his research and the role type systems and comonads could play in the
design of cryptographic algorithms. Along the way, he gave an
accessible introduction to post-quantum cryptography which we really
enjoyed. We hope you do, too.
