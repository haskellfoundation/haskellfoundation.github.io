We are joined by Kathrin Stark, a professor at Heriot-Watt University
in Edinburgh. Kathrin works on program verification with proof
assistants, so her focus is not exactly on Haskell, but on topics dear
to Haskellers' hearts such as interactive theorem provers, writing
correct programs, and the activities needed to produce them. We
discuss many aspects of proofs and specifications, and the languages
involved in the process, as well as verifying and producing provably
correct neural networks.
