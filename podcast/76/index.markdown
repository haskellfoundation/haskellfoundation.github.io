Welcome to the Haskell Interlude. Today, Matti and Mike talk to
Jeffrey Young. Jeff has had a long history of working with Haskell and
on ghc itself. We talk about what makes Haskell so compelling, the
good and bad of highly optimized code and the beauty of
well-modularized code, how to get into compiler development, and how
to benefit from Domain-Driven Design.

Jeff is currently on the job market - if you want to get in touch,
