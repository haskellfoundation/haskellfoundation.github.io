The Haskell Foundation is happy to announce a new joint initiative with Well-Typed: Haskell Ecosystem Support Packages!

Well-Typed, leveraging its deep expertise in Haskell core tools, is offering Ecosystem Support Packages. These packages provide a direct means of investing in Haskellâ€™s core tools while receiving technical support from Well-Typed. As the Foundation receives some portion of the funds to do its work, we worked with Well-Typed to ensure that the package levels correspond to the sponsorship levels of the Foundation.

These packages provide a meaningful way for organizations to get direct support for their Haskell needs while still supporting the wider Haskell ecosystem. This is not a hypothetical, there are already companies that have purchased these packages that would otherwise not have been able to support the Haskell Foundation directly.

You can read more information about Well-Typed's offering [on the Ecosystem Support Package of their website](https://well-typed.com/ecosystem/).

Thank you to Well-Typed for spearheading this collaboration!
