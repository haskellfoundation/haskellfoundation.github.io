    <h2>Preamble</h2>

    <p>
      The Haskell Foundation has adopted the Standards of Public Behaviour set
      out below. As representatives of the Foundation, we commit ourselves to
      those standards and we aspire to apply them in all our public interactions
      in the Haskell sphere, including email, social media and discussion
      forums.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standards apply to our behaviour; that is, what we do. They
      specifically do not, and should not, seek to constrain anyone's beliefs;
      that is, what they think.
    </p>
    <p>
      If one of us fails to meet these standards, the ideal course of action is
      to write to that person privately, gently drawing attention to their
      lapse. If you are not comfortable with that, please contact the Chair of
      the Foundation, or (if the Chair is the problem) the Vice-Chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our response should usually be to apologise and stop doing what it was
      that you are unhappy about. Even if we feel we have been misinterpreted or
      unfairly accused, the chances are good there was something we could have
      communicated better, and an apology is far more likely to bring healing
      than is a counter-accusation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not seek to impose these standards on members of the Haskell
      community. Rather, adopting the standards is a signal that we seek high
      standards of discourse in the Haskell community, and are willing to
      publicly hold ourselves to that standard, in the hope that others may
      voluntarily follow suit.
    </p>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>
      We are motivated to adopt these standards for several reasons, including:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Diversity and inclusion. We recognize that the Haskell community,
        echoing the technology industry more generally, skews white and male. We
        see it as our duty and honour to spread the joy of Haskell widely and to
        broaden the patterns of participation, in the hopes that, one day, we
        will no longer be askew.
      </li>
      <li>
        Making an explicit commitment will encourage us to review our messages
        to see if they meet the goals set out here, and will give others some
        specifics to point to if we fail.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>

    <p>
      We would like to thank the communities and projects that established code
      of conducts and diversity statements as our inspiration. They include:

    <h2>Our Standards of Public Behaviour</h2>

    <p>Version: 2025-05-29</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The over-arching rule: <b>We strive to treat every person with respect.</b>
      </li>
      <li>
        We welcome into the Haskell community people of all backgrounds,
        identities, and beliefs, provided only that they in turn behave in the
        respectful way articulated in these standards.
      </li>
      <li>
        We treat everyone with courtesy, aware that their diverse backgrounds,
        experiences, goals, and perspectives may be very different to ours.
      </li>
      <li>
        In our communication, we consistently honour and affirm the passion,
        professional expertise, and good intentions of others. When we doubt
        these qualities in someone else, we prefer to deal with those matters
        discreetly, instead of making public accusations.
      </li>
      <li>
        We strive to be scrupulously polite at all times. There should be no
        rudeness, name-calling, or harassment in our communication.
      </li>
      <li>
        We avoid forms of expression and other behaviours that attack,
        humiliate, demean, or marginalise - even where we disagree with that
        person.
      </li>
      <li>
        Disagreement itself is fine: we are enriched by robust technical debate.
        But we seek to make the tone of that debate to be a conversation among
        people who respect, or even admire, each other.
      </li>
      <li>
        Where we disagree, we try to be curious about the perspective, goals,
        motivation, and priorities of the other person.
      </li>
    </ul>
