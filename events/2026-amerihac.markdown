## Discord

We have a Discord server for those that want to socialize/plan/coordinate before and during the event: [Discord link](https://discord.gg/qFQDT4v3).
Feel we'll make channels for specific projects upon request.

## Organization

Much like ZuriHac, there will be dedicated space for specific projects (GHC,
cabal, stack, etc.), with the full details being determined by registrant
interest. You can work on anything, and there's no competition!
We're just working on projects that are interesting to us and learning from each other.
