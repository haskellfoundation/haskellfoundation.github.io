We are excited to announce the **2025 Haskell Ecosystem Workshop, June 5 2025**, organized by the Haskell Foundation and the OST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences! This is a workshop for those who want to gain a deeper understanding of using Haskell in large systems.

In this one-day event, held on the lakeside campus of OST in lovely Rapperswil, Switzerland.

The following speakers have been confirmed, with more to follow:

* Simon Marlow: Lessons learned from Haskell at Scale
* Andrew Lelechenko: Thoughts on choosing the right Haskell
* Jose Calderon: State of the Haskell Ecosystem

There will also be experts on ecosystem-wide issues (e.g. Security), in order to facilitate conversations about how to address cross-cutting issues in our tooling ecosystem.

We will update the list of confirmed speakers as we receive confirmation.


## In-Person Attendance

Registration for in-person attendance will be managed via Eventbrite. Because of the space available registration will be limited to the first 70 participants. Monad and Applicative level sponsors to the Haskell Foundation have a set of reserved seats. These reserved seats will be released to the general pool if they go unused by the sponsors.

The registration link is available [on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/2025-workshops-at-zurihac-tickets-1247256801669?aff=oddtdtcreator)

## Video Recordings

The recordings [are available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQpeDZt0_xQe319u9EdkpxjibYFtGsugc).

## The Workshop

This workshop is aimed toward industrial practioners that leverage Haskell for non-trivial tools and applications. Navigating the landscape of Haskell features and language extensions can often reveal difficulties in maintaining, debugging, and updating Haskell codebases.
At this workshop, you can hear from experts that have navigated this landscape and returned with hard-won lessons on developing and maintaining large scale Haskell software.

Additionally, the speakers will be available to answer questions and to provide mentorship during Zurihac itself, so this is a great opportunity to pick their brains!

We expect that participants already know Haskell and have worked on some form of programming language implementation in the past, whether as students, at work, or just for fun. Concepts such as parsing, type checking, unification, and code generation should be familiar, but we don't expect participants to already be experts.

## Practical Information and Schedule

The workshop will be held at the [Rapperswil-Jona campus of OST](https://www.ost.ch/en/university-of-applied-sciences/campus/rapperswil-jona-campus). It is right next to the Rapperswil train station, at [Oberseestrasse 10](https://goo.gl/maps/DkF6U9qdgdjcMfz29). The [Zurihac 2024 site](https://zfoh.ch/zurihac2024/) has instructions for transportation between Rapperswil and Zürich.

All talks and presentations will be held in an air-conditioned classroom that will be configured conference-style, which means that most seats won't have a table or desk attached. During the event, we'll let you know which additional spaces are good for compiler hacking. We will post the exact room number when that becomes available.

### Preparation

Swiss electricity is 220 volts, 50 Hz AC. [Swiss power outlets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AC_power_plugs_and_sockets#Swiss_SN_441011_(Type_J)) are different than in many European countries, so please bring an appropriate adapter if necessary. Drinking fountains are not common in Europe, so please bring a refillable water bottle.

<!--
If you intend on 
Please make sure that you have [checked out and built](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/building) a recent GHC from source **before arriving**. In a separate checkout, please [build the JavaScript backend](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/javascript-backend/building) as well. You should also have a working [GHC GitLab account](https://gitlab.haskell.org/users/sign_up) prior to arrival. If you have difficulties, the GHC developers have recommended asking for support in `#ghc` on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#ghc:libera.chat) or IRC.

</table>

All times are in CEST using a 24-hour clock. Speakers have been asked to plan appropriate breaks during their timeslots.

We don't expect every participant to attend every presentation. It's perfectly acceptable to skip a topic that you're less interested in so you can hack on a topic that you are interested in, taking advantage of ready access to the experts for hands-on assistance.


### Lunch and Refreshments

We will eat lunch in the OST canteen, called Mensa. While Mensa is open from 11:00-13:15, it is very busy from 11:45-12:30 because classes are in session, and they've asked that we go before or after. Talks have been scheduled to account for this.

Coffee, tea, and fruit will be provided. There is also easy access to a tap for water. Dinner is on your own. There is a grocery store very near the campus where other products can be purchased as well.


## Participation

Due to space constraints and to enable scholarships for student participants, there will be a fee for full on-site participation.
Fees will be used to cover travel costs for presenters, other direct costs of running the event, and students who don't have other funding to attend.
The fee depends on participant category:

 * _Enrolled students_ ($$20) are participants who are enrolled full-time at an educational institution. 

 * _Individual professionals_ ($$200) are no longer students and are interested in working on GHC for their own purposes. 

 * _Corporate participants_ ($$600) are being paid by their employer to attend so that they can use the knowledge that they gain on the job. Corporate participants will have their company name on their name tag and their company will be listed on the event web page as a supporter of the event.
 
All fees are in US dollars.
We want the event to be as accessible as possible, given our limitations, so if the fee is a barrier to attending, please contact Jose Calderon at [jmct@haskell.foundation](mailto:jmct@haskell.foundation) to discuss a reduced or waived fee—this goes for all three categories of participant.

A certificate of completion will be available on advance request to students who attend the entire event.

Remote participation will make use of the Zurihac infrastructure. We will do our best to stream presentations and to post recordings as quickly as possible, and we will also have a chat system for remote participants.
